**SBI Banking System in Python**  

The **SBI Banking System** is a Python-based application that simulates essential banking operations, allowing customers to manage their accounts efficiently. This project leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure a structured and modular approach to banking functionalities.  

#### **Key Features:**  
✔ **Customer Account Management** – Users can create accounts with details like name, phone number, age, Aadhaar number, and address. Each account is assigned a unique account number.  
✔ **Balance Inquiry** – Customers can check their current account balance by providing their account number and PIN.  
✔ **Deposits & Withdrawals** – Users can securely deposit and withdraw money, with transactions being recorded in a history log.  
✔ **Transaction History** – Every deposit and withdrawal is stored with a timestamp, transaction type, and updated balance.  
✔ **Security Measures** – PIN authentication is required for sensitive operations like withdrawals, modifications, and PIN changes.  
✔ **Account Modifications** – Customers can update their name, address, or phone number after verification.  
✔ **Data Validation** – Phone numbers, Aadhaar numbers, and PINs are validated using static methods to ensure correct input.  

#### **Technology Used:**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Concepts Applied:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Static & Class Methods, Data Validation, Exception Handling  
- **Libraries Used:** `datetime` (for transaction timestamps)  

This project provides a **realistic simulation of banking operations**, enhancing customer experience with **secure transactions and data integrity**. It demonstrates expertise in **Python programming, OOP concepts, and real-world application development**.
